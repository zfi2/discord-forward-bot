# Discord message forwarding bot

A discord self-bot to forward all incoming messages from one discord account to another, while also notifying the initial user that messaged you that you're unavailable(or something else, the message is customizable).\
Useful if you have a main account and and alt account that you don't visit much, mostly coded for my own sake.
